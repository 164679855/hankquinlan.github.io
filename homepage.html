				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The Duanwu Festival, also often known as the Dragon Boat Festival, is a traditional 
				holiday originating in China, occurring near the summer solstice. It is also known as 
				Zhongxiao Festival (Chinese: 忠孝節; pinyin: Zhōngxiàojié), commemorating fealty and filial piety. 
				The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional Chinese calendar, 
				which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the Double Fifth Festival. 
				The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, so the date of the festival varies from year to year 
				on the Gregorian calendar. In 2017, it occurred on 30 May; in 2018, on 18 June; and, in 2019, on 7 June.

				Practices and activities[
			</h4>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Three of the most widespread activities conducted during the Duanwu Festival 
				are eating (and preparing) zongzi, drinking realgar wine, and racing dragon boats.

			    	<li>Dragon boat racing</li>
			    	<p>
			    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			    		Dragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, 
			    	which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with 
			    	the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was 
			    	slandered by jealous government officials and banished by king. Out of disappointment in 
			    	the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo river. The common people rushed to 
			    	the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon 
			    	boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice 
			    	into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of 
			    	the origins of zongzi.
			    	</p>
			    <li>Zongzi（rice dumpling)</li>
			    <p>
			    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			    	A notable part of celebrating Duanwu is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. 
			    	People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. 
			    	The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings 
			    	vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean 
			    	paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of 
			    	fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs. 
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			    	The reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol 
			    	of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (中). This character 
			    	has a positive connotation, used in words such as 中奖 (winning a prize). 
			    </p>
			    <li>Food related to 5</li>
			   
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Wu (午) in the name Duanwu in Chinese has similar pronunciation as the number 5, and thus many regions 
			have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong 
			regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans.
